Doctest Report Logs
-------------------

The $MODULE_NAME.report files contain the full output for doctests run through doctest_vcs.py.
Mainly they are generated so that a more readable .md file can be created, but they are handy to look through
if you need more detail on what is going on during the doctest process.
