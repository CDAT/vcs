Markdown Log Files
------------------

These files contain a markdown-formatted summary of any doctest errors encountered, and any objects in the module that don't have doctests.

The 'Missing Doctests' section can be a good indicator for where more documentation is needed.

As far as errors are concerned, no news is good news. If you have a .md file that contains nothing, it's probably not missing doctests,
and is passing all doctests.

For instructions on how to generate these log files, see doctest_info/scripts/README.md .
